From memory our accepations are:
a) Low access time b) High Capacity c)Low cost
Keep Lowest access time memory near to cpu

Address Binding :- Mapping of relocatable address to physical address.
Compile time address binding, load time binding, RunTime binding  (check on internet for more details) 
Runtime Binding: In runtime binding address that takes for cpu are logical address and then at runtime that replace by physical address.
Replace is done by using limit register or realocation register. 

Evalution of memory management :-
Single tasking system , multitasking system
Memory allocation in multitasking: 
static :- a)Equal Size b) Unequal Size
dynamice: a) Contihous b) Non-contiguous 
Non contigeous: 1) paging 2)segmentation 3) paging with segmentation 
Extrenal Fragmentation :- When there are sufficient memory but in differnt junks
Internal Fragmentation :- Whem more memory is allocated than needed. Internal fragmentation is the cause of external fragmentation.
Two ways to manage holes dynamic partitioning :- a)bitmap (required lots of unit) b) Linked list 
TLB
Demand Paging
Thrashing 
Page replacement algorithms 
Segmentation: Alternate of Paging where a process is divided into related group according to user's view. It use for both ideas where paging is used noncontigious allocation and virtual memory. 
Segmentation with paging
